## Concepts Used
1. **Linear Regression**: Supervised learning to model salary predictions.
2. **Train-Test Split**: Divide the dataset for training and testing the model.
3. **Data Visualization**: Scatterplots and regression lines using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
4. **Interactive Predictions**: Real-time input for dynamic results via Streamlit.
